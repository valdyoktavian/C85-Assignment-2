  CSC C85 - Embedded Systems - Project # 1 - EV3 Robot Localization
   
 This file provides the headers for the EV3 localization starter code. Please have a look to
see what is provided by the starter. The corresponding .c file contains the implementation
as well as clearly defined *** TO DO *** sections that correspond to the parts of the 
code that you have to complete in order to implement the localization algorithms.
 
 In a nutshell, the starter code provides:
 
 * Reading a map from an input image (in .ppm format). The map is bordered with red, 
   must have black streets with yellow intersections, and buildings must be either
   blue, green, or be left white (no building).
   
 * Setting up an array with map information which contains, for each intersection,
   the colours of the buildings around it in ** CLOCKWISE ** order from the top-left.
   
 * Initialization of the EV3 robot (opening a socket and setting up the communication
   between your laptop and your bot)
   
 What you must implement:
 
 * All aspects of robot control:
   - Finding and then following a street
   - Recognizing intersections
   - Scanning building colours around intersections
   - Detecting the map boundary and turning around or going back - the robot must not
     wander outside the map (though of course it's possible parts of the robot will
     leave the map while turning at the boundary)

 * The histogram-based localization algorithm that the robot will use to determine its
   location in the map - this is as discussed in lecture.

 * Basic robot exploration strategy so the robot can scan different intersections in
   a sequence that allows it to achieve reliable localization
   
 * Basic path planning - once the robot has found its location, it must drive toward a 
   user-specified position somewhere in the map.

 What you need to understand thoroughly in order to complete this project:
 
 * The histogram localization method as discussed in lecture. The general steps of
   probabilistic robot localization.

 * Sensors and signal management - your colour readings will be noisy and unreliable,
   you have to handle this smartly
   
 * Robot control with feedback - your robot does not perform exact motions, you can
   assume there will be error and drift, your code has to handle this.
   
 * The robot control API you will use to get your robot to move, and to acquire 
   sensor data. Please see the API directory and read through the header files and
   attached documentation
